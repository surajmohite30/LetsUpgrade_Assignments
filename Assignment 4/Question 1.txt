Question 1
By how many ways we can access elements in the DOM and write about them in brief?
document.getElementsByTagName("Tag_Name");
By getElementsByTagName we can access elements using the HTML tags. Which ever type of element tag we want to access we can access using the above function. The getElementsByTagName gives
us array of all the elements specified with "TagName" and it can be access using its index number.

e.g.: how can we access
<p>JavaScript is Awesome</p>
var s=document.getElementsByTagName("p") //we fetch the data having <p> tag in present inside HTML document in form of array of s
console.log(s[]) //gives all the elements having <p> tag. <p> JavaScript is Awesome </p>
console.log(s[0]) //gives the element having index value 0. <p> JavaScript is Awesome </p>
console.log(s[0].innerText) //gives value present inside the tag having index 0. JavaScript is Awesome
console.log(s[0].innerHTML("<h3>JavaScript is Beautiful</h3>"))  //change the content within <p> tag performing html tag operation. JavaScript is Beautiful with H3 heading style

document.getElementsByClassName("Class_Name");
By getElementsByClassName we can access elements using the class name which we specified in tags. Which ever type of element tag we want to access we can access using the above 
function. The getElementsByClassName gives us array of all the elements specified with "ClassName" and it can be access using its index number.

e.g.: 
<p class="javaSPack">JavaScript is Awesome</p>
var a=document.getElementsByClassName("javaSPack"); //we fetch the data using class name present inside HTML document in form of array of a
console.log(a[]) //gives all the elements having classname. <p class="javaSPack">JavaScript is Awesome</p>
console.log(a[0]) //gives the element having index value 0 <p class="javaSPack">JavaScript is Awesome</p>
console.log(a[0].innerText)  //JavaScript is Awesome


document.getElementById ("Ele_Id");
By getElementById we can access elements using the id which we specified in tags. Here we don't get array, here we can directly access the elements as the id are unique for each element.
Also if we provide two or more elements with same id we can access them using the index number
e.g.: how can we access
<h3 id=subTitle>JavaScript by LetsUpgrade</h3>
var b = document.getElementById ("subTitle");    
console.log ( b ); // <p id = "subTitle"> JavaScript by LetsUpgrade </p>
console.log ( b.innetText ); //JavaScript by LetsUpgrade
